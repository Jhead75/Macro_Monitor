Purpose: For my final project, I wanted to build on the Python, SQL, CSS, and HTML that was taught in class.
         I also wanted to build something that I might use, so starting with the distribution from the finance lesson
         as a basis, I built a nutritional macro counter. The tool allows a user to register, set a target calorie and
         macro (protein, carbohydrates, and fat) goal, build a food library, and enter those foods into a daily log.
         The tool then tracks where the user is at based on their daily goals and presents that information visually,
         in the form of a pie chart. Finally, once a user is close to their daily calorie goal (less than 200 calories
         from goal), the tool runs an algorithm that looks at every food in the user's library and recommends whatever
         item will bring that user closest to his/her exact goals.
